Thanks to Docker, which we use here.
We don't need to install Python globally on our system, it's in the image and container instead.
We could have a Python 3.7 based app next to a Python 3.9 based app without switching python versions in between.

We're also using it to share our images and containers with others.
That could be team members who are working on the same project, or that could be servers on which we wanna deploy our containers.
