docker run -i image-id -> create and start a container in a interactive mode
flags ["-i"]

-i interactive mode

docker start -ai -> start the container attached & interactive mode

When using Docker run we are attached to the container so we can listen to output printed by the container
but we're not attached to it in the sense of being able to enter anything
to input something into the container use -i interactive mode
